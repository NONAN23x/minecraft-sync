## Purpose 🎯

Minecraft Sync was born out of frustration with the endless hassle of getting friends' Minecraft setups to match mine! 😤 If you've ever spent hours walking non-tech-savvy friends through mod installations, config tweaks, and version matching just to play together, you know the pain. This tool was originally created for my personal use and my friend group - because life's too short to troubleshoot mod conflicts when you just want to build and explore together! 🎮👥
